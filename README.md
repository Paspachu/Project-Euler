This repository includes the answers to the Project Euler problems.

The problems can be found here:

All the answers are in C++ and ran through Visual Studio Code in Windows 10.

Please note that the codes may not be optimal all the time, so any suggestion or question is welcome.

Version Control:
(1) version_1_0 is the lowest version, meaning that it is the first file that solved the problem.
(2) version_1_c is the updated version of version_1_0, so the higher c value, the better the version is.
(3) version_c_0 is a completely different answer to the problem, so the c value simply distinguishs the version.
